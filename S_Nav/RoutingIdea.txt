User selects floor x && floor y
	- check for difference in floor numbers between start and end location
		- ex location.substring(1,1)
	- if no difference 
		- routing is on single floor
	- else 
		- replace the destination location value with the nearest traversal point
			- will require a distance lookup
		- route to that traversal point
		- user clicks go up button
		- current destination is replaced with next floors traversal point
			- keeping traversal points named same is key for this
		- call regular routing with updated current position and now accurate end destination

User selects wing x && wing y
	- similar to above but change from using a traversal point as temporary destination
	to a wing point(? don't know if we have a name for these yet)
